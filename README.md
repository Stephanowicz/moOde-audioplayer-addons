## requirements & installation
- Tested with moOde audioplayer v9.x  
should also work with v8.x (will NOT work with v7.x)
  
 
- Download the repo and copy the **addons** folder and it's subfolders into the www-root folder */var/www/*  
the folder structure then should look like this:  
	/var/www/addons/Stephanowicz/...  
	The folder structure is important as all scripts rely on it  



- Generally You need to add a link to **addons.js** in **/var/www/header.php**  
-> below the `<!-- Common JS -->` section in **header.php** You should find a link to *lib.min.js*: `<script src="js/lib.min.js?t=1729607710734" defer></script>`   
after this add `<script src="addons/addons.js?t=1729607710734" defer></script>`  
(the *t=xxxx* can be different - you may copy the one from lib.min.js) 
- make sure that /var/www/addons/Stephanowicz/**config.json** is writeable for all  
-> sudo chmod 666 /var/www/addons/Stephanowicz/config.json

 

1. Extended Albumart
	- requires [getid3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3)  
	  install with: 
		- wget -O ~/getid3.zip https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/archive/master.zip
		- sudo 7z e ~/getid3.zip -aoa -o/var/www/inc/getid3/ getID3-master/getid3/*.php
  		- (or copy the  **getid3 subfolder** manually to */var/www/inc/*)
		- sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/inc/getid3/

2. Youtube audioplayback
	- requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)  
	  install with: 
		- sudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl  
      		-> sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
    
    	As youtube changes its code from time to time You may need to update yt-dlp to get it working again.   
	  -->  sudo youtube-dl --update-to nightly  

		
4. Songlyrics  
	at moment there are 3 methods to get the songlyrics: genius.com, lrclib.net and local files  
 	(generally any script that takes "artist=xxx" and "title=xxx" as parameters and outputs (html-)formatted text could be used.)  
    
 	For local files the extensions ".txt" and ".lrc" are supported   
	The files need to be located in the songfolder and must contain the songtitle	  
	The ".lrc" files are generated by [lrcget](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget/tree/main) and may contain the songposition which will be filtered for plain display  
	If a file is found it will be displayed instead of querying genius or lrclib.  

	[LRCLIB Lyrics](https://lrclib.net/)  
	- requires php-curl  
	  install with: 
		- sudo apt-get install php-curl

	  LRCLIB also provides synced lyrics

	[Genius Lyrics](http://genius.com)  
	- requires php-xml(php-dom), php-curl    
	  install with: 
		- sudo apt-get install php-xml php-curl  
	  
		- You will also need a **client access token** for the [Genius Lyrics](http://genius.com) API ->
		- Create a free account: [Genius Lyrics API](http://genius.com/api-clients )
		- then create a [new API client](https://genius.com/api-clients/new)  
		("App Website URL" and "Redirect URI" can be anything)
		- finally generate a [client access token](https://genius.com/api-clients) by clicking "Generate Access Token"  
	 	-> add the **client access token** to **clientaccesstoken.txt** in the lyrics folder */var/www/addons/Stephanowicz/lyrics*  
   
  
     
	The other addons don't have any further requirements

## Addons

With /var/www/addons/Stephanowicz/**config.json** the addons can be dis-/enabled.  
A config-page will help You by doing so. This page also checks if the requirements are met.  
The config-page can be accessed by the **m**(oode-menu)  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555baaa8-2ef9-475c-b306-28f7d3261c42)  

(You can also do that in a seperate window: [config-page](http://moode9.local/addons/Stephanowicz/config.html)  `http://moode9.local/addons/Stephanowicz/config.html`)

1. Extended Albumart
	- Displays embedded images and files in the albumfolder as thumbnails below albumcover and on the audioinfo page.  
  	Below the albumcover 3 dots signalize that images are available  
   	![Albumart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b440306d-3184-414d-b4e3-e982eb6f92bb)   
	a click on the dots opens the thumblist below  
	![Albumart1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ee4bc8-3f58-4ffb-a7ca-05f5f1677a3e)  
	a click on a thumb shows the image in albumview  
	![Albumart2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c3c8a83-a8ea-4e1a-8f9f-a6624c5d1ecf)  
	a doubleclick opens the image in a modal view  
	![Albumart3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a53b84-bbfd-4eb8-a9b5-7f642cc6f84e)  
	in the Audio Information modal, the images are listed with more info at the end of the file infos

2. Youtube audioplayback
	- parses youtube playlists or single videos and adds them to playlist  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/069b8a15-b197-4d4e-b93d-49acd94ec4a4)  
	You have the option to add a link to a single video or a link to a video playlist.  
	Keep in mind that single links and the links generated from the playlists last only a few hours!  
	While the link to a playlist should stay the same for a long time.  
	Therefore You have the option to safe the playlist-url and reuse it later - but still the links to the audiosource have to be generated!  
	
   	After adding a link, ytdl starts a query for the link(s) of the audiosource(s)  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/858e6a80-8b69-4701-a8ab-27bbe0942f22)  
 	You have the option to clear the playlist before adding or to append to the list.  
	(You also have the option to add them to the current moOde playlist - but any information about title/artist will not be available)  
	
	When clicking *create playlist*, ytdl creates a playlist for mpd (youtube.m3u)
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d1535f8-e4cf-4c8e-8fee-473e605f461c) 

	*load & play* finally starts the playback

	There's also an independent page available that can be opened outside of moOde-audioplayer:  
	[http://moode.local/addons/Stephanowicz/youtubeDL/youtube.html](http://moode.local/addons/Stephanowicz/youtubeDL/youtube.html)



3. Graphics equalizer

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af8d756-3970-47e4-a49d-5edcd8417aa5)  
	You can save presets and reload them.  
	When selecting a different preset, the changes are signalized by red bars - by clicking *load* the preset will be activated  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd933489-e99f-461a-bbe7-34cdd9f32a75)  

	
4. Songlyrics
	- query lyrics of current song and display them in a modal  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f61711-1f0c-44bc-b5df-2ab6b8ebf7eb)
	  
	- show synced lyrics from LRCLIB above the albumcover 
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d8c065-1aeb-40da-a168-c93968f68b21)

    a small green dot above the icon indicates that synced lyrics are available   
	activate the synced lyrics display with clicking the right button below playback control  
    if synced lyrics are available the button turns green, otherwise it turns red  
	(be aware that sometimes the synced lyrics maybe from a (special) edition and don't fit properly)  

	
6. Playbackmenue / Playbar icons
	- Add/remove items for playbackcontrol on mainscreen - "repeat", "random", "single", "random album", "add to favourites"  etc...
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef1deacc-5fef-4c33-9947-474d9194d9fd)  
	Removed items are placed in the pop-up menue  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/873f2767-8699-4140-b7e0-813b02874d6e)  

7. Show Songtitle, Albumname and albumicon in browsertitlebar or tab  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c6f3e3-3b67-4911-8156-28cea76f9f5b)  
	Tip: use a bare window without controls for the moOde audioplayer  
	for edge (chrome?) you need to add the params `--app=http://moode9.local --window-size=800,600` to the browser command:  
	`msedge --app=http://moode9.local --window-size=800,600`  
	(this should also be possible for firefox etc. - but I don't know the commands at moment)  

8. Browse to folder 
	- Contextmenue-option to browse to songfolder in folderview  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/085b1245-e2c2-4642-9e35-64186c2a4251)  
	->  
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00044b3e-9255-454d-913c-d0226c592425)  

9. Show total and remainig/elapsed playtime below playlist  
	- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b5049d-a9b4-4ce8-8b68-6c51aa6bcc01)
 	- remaining or elapsed playtime will be shown according to Your general display setting of showing playtime

10. Increase text-size of Artist, Title, Album in screen-saver wide-mode
    - at moment a fixed size... I'm thinking of to make it adjustable 

11. Fix for local ultrawide displays like 11.9inch Capacitive Touch Screen LCD, 1480x320  
    e.g [https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/11.9inch_HDMI_LCD](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/11.9inch_HDMI_LCD)
      
    This is how the main screen looks like originally with 1480x320:  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b01de58-3c23-4462-9749-c05a72d8ea8b)  

    and this is how it looks like with the fix:  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa64085-8ec3-4b3b-9fe9-1f7b61cb9e8f)  

12. Fix for playback context-menue out of scope for large menues with many items  
   menue out of scope:  
   ![contextmenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc4967f-0ab2-4143-a942-228f13b4af77)  
   
   position fixed:  
   ![contextmenue_fix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64698b36-31cf-4a4d-a4b7-86acf9285b22)

12. Pre-listen to audio-file  
    If You have a playlist, and maybe are already playing audio, You can pre-listen to another song without changing the current playlist.  
    The playback will continue afterwards at the current song position. (i.e. the previous playbackstate will be restored)

That's it - have fun!
